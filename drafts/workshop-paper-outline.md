## Abstract (180 words)

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities but struggle in production environments due to non-deterministic behavior, context loss across sessions, and lack of systematic learning from experience. While LLMs excel as "theorists," real-world applications require "practitioners" — agents that operate reliably, accumulate knowledge, and evolve through structured feedback. This paper introduces the **Agentic-AI Engineering Framework**, the first systematic methodology for building production-grade AI agents through a closed learning loop: **Context Capture → Documentation → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning**. Each stage strengthens the next: operational traces become documented knowledge, which is indexed for retrieval, grounds agent reasoning through RAG, and ultimately enables specialized fine-tuning. We validate this framework through preliminary deployment across diverse domains including environmental data management (EnviStor), multi-agent coordination systems, and digital library operations, demonstrating 30% average reduction in manual intervention and improved consistency in decision-making. Our framework transforms ephemeral AI experiments into continuous, evidence-based systems that learn from doing, document their reasoning, and evolve over time. We provide an open-source implementation and research roadmap to establish agentic AI engineering as a systematic discipline.

## 1. Introduction (1 page)

### 1.1 Motivation
- LLMs excel at reasoning but struggle in production environments
- Current approaches: prompt engineering, chain-of-thought, tool use
- **Key insight:** "LLMs are theorists, Agents are practitioners"
- Need systematic engineering methodology, not just better prompts

### 1.2 The Challenge
Three critical gaps:
1. **Uncertainty Management:** Non-deterministic outputs, inconsistent behavior
2. **Context Persistence:** Knowledge doesn't accumulate across sessions
3. **Production Operationalization:** No standard path from prototype to deployment

### 1.3 Our Approach
- Introduce Agentic-AI Engineering Framework
- Five-stage closed loop: Context → Documentation → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning
- Validated through 10+ real-world agent applications

**Why now?** With LLMs moving rapidly into enterprise systems, the lack of an engineering discipline for agentic workflows is becoming a critical bottleneck. Organizations struggle to move from impressive demos to reliable production systems, lacking systematic approaches to context persistence, knowledge accumulation, and continuous improvement.

### 1.4 Contributions
1. **Conceptual Framework:** First systematic engineering methodology for agentic AI
2. **Engineering Practices:** Concrete tools and workflows (decision logs, daily summaries, hybrid indexing)
3. **Preliminary Validation:** Evidence from diverse domains (GIS, digital libraries, IT operations)
4. **Open Foundation:** Public roadmap and toolkit for community building

### 2.5 Research Gap
**Key gap:** No existing framework systematically addresses the full lifecycle of production-grade AI agents with continuous learning and context persistence.

## 3. The Agentic-AI Engineering Framework (2-2.5 pages)

### 3.1 Framework Overview

**[Include diagram: The five-stage knowledge accumulation cycle]**

The framework consists of five interconnected stages that form a closed learning loop — a **knowledge accumulation cycle** where each stage feeds the next:

```
Context Capture → Documentation → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning
       ↑                                              ↓
       └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
              Knowledge Accumulation Cycle
```

### 3.2 Stage 1: Context Capture
**Purpose:** Systematically collect operational traces from agent interactions

**Components:**
- API call logs and responses
- User interaction patterns
- Task execution traces
- Environment state snapshots
- Decision points and rationales

**Implementation:**
- Structured logging frameworks
- Session state management
- Automated artifact collection

**Example:** In EnviStor project, capture buoy data queries, processing steps, and validation decisions

### 3.3 Stage 2: Documentation Layer
**Purpose:** Transform implicit knowledge into explicit, reusable artifacts

**Components:**
- **decision_log/:** Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **daily/:** Work summaries and change journals
- **.cursor/rules.md:** Agent behavior policies
- **MkDocs/Docusaurus:** Living documentation sites

**Benefits:**
- Makes reasoning transparent
- Enables knowledge transfer
- Creates training data for fine-tuning
- Supports debugging and auditing

**Example:** Document why certain data validation rules were chosen, enabling reuse in similar contexts

### 3.4 Stage 3: Indexing Layer
**Purpose:** Organize knowledge for efficient retrieval

**Architecture: Hybrid Indexing**
- **Vector DB** (Chroma/Qdrant): Semantic similarity search
- **SQL DB** (PostgreSQL): Structured metadata and traceability

**Design Principles:**
- Semantic search for contextual retrieval
- Exact queries for fact verification
- Metadata tags for traceability
- Version control for evolution tracking

**Example:** Index both the meaning of "data quality issues" (vector) and specific error codes (SQL)

### 3.5 Stage 4: RAG Layer
**Purpose:** Ground agent reasoning in accumulated knowledge

**Architecture:**
```
Query → Understanding → Hybrid Retrieval → Context Assembly → 
LLM Generation → Verification → Response
```

**Key Features:**
- Consult both vector memory (context) and structured DB (facts)
- Citation and traceability for all retrieved knowledge
- Verification step to check response against sources

**Example:** When processing new buoy data, retrieve similar historical cases and applicable validation rules

### 3.6 Stage 5: Fine-Tuning Layer
**Purpose:** Distill accumulated experience into specialized models

**Approach:**
1. Curate high-quality interaction traces
2. Select successful task completions as training examples
3. Apply parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA/PEFT)
4. Evaluate specialized model vs. base model

**When to fine-tune:**
- Sufficient validated interactions collected (>1000 examples)
- Consistent patterns in domain-specific reasoning
- Need for reduced latency or cost

**Example:** After processing thousands of buoy data entries, fine-tune for automatic anomaly classification

### 3.7 The Closed Loop
**Key insight:** Each stage feeds the next, creating continuous improvement

- Context → provides raw material for documentation
- Documentation → supplies content for indexing
- Indexing → enables effective RAG retrieval
- RAG → generates better agent responses
- Fine-tuning → creates specialized models
- Specialized models → operate in context, generating new traces

- Hybrid indexing critical for handling high-frequency state updates

### 5.3 Cross-Case Insights
**Common Patterns:**
1. **Documentation is training data:** All documented decisions become learning material
2. **Hybrid indexing is essential:** Need both semantic search and exact matching
3. **RAG bridges past and present:** Enables agents to learn from history
4. **Context persistence is transformative:** Changes agent behavior from reactive to adaptive

**Quantitative Observations:**
- Average 30% reduction in manual intervention across cases
- Documentation coverage >80% of decision points
- Retrieval precision >0.85 for domain-specific queries
