# DIVA Publication Roadmap (2025-2027)

**Project:** Dataverse Intelligent Virtual Assistant  
**Lead Author:** Dr. Boyuan (Keven) Guan  
**Institution:** Florida International University - Library & GIS Center  
**Strategy:** Multi-stage publication for maximum academic impact

---

## Publication Strategy Overview

### Core Approach: Workshop → Conference → Journal

DIVA is **production-ready** but its research narrative (learning loop, governance, human-AI trust) is **still evolving**. This three-stage strategy maximizes both early visibility and long-term impact:

1. **Workshop Paper** — Early exposure, community feedback, fast timeline
2. **Full Conference Paper** — Mature system architecture, extended evaluation
3. **Journal Extension** — Long-term deployment analysis, comprehensive lessons

This pattern is standard in systems research (robotics, AI-ops, HCI):
> "We first introduced the system in [Workshop], and later present the extended study in [Conference/Journal]."
