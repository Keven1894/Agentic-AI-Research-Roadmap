# Agentic AI Framework Case Studies

**Purpose:** Document real-world applications of the Agentic-AI Engineering Framework across domains  
**Status:** Active collection — submissions welcome!  
**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025

---

## Overview

This directory contains **production-validated case studies** demonstrating the Agentic-AI Engineering Framework in action across different domains. Each case study provides evidence that the framework's adaptive progression (Stages 0-4) produces reliable, maintainable, evolvable AI agents.

**Why Case Studies Matter:**

1. **Validation** — Prove framework effectiveness in real environments
2. **Generalizability** — Demonstrate cross-domain applicability
3. **Learning** — Share patterns, insights, and lessons learned
4. **Community** — Build collective knowledge about agentic AI engineering

#### 3. Framework Application

**Stage Identification:**
- Which framework stage you're currently at (0-4)
- Why you're at this stage (information volume, constraints)
- Evolution path if you progressed through multiple stages

**Implementation Details:**

For each applicable stage, document:

**Stage 0: System Prompt (if applicable)**
- Initial prompt design
- Domain knowledge encoded
- Capabilities defined

**Stage 1: Documentation (if applicable)**
- Documentation structure

**Stage 4: Fine-Tuning (if applicable)**
- Training data curation approach
- Fine-tuning method (LoRA, PEFT, etc.)
- Baseline vs. fine-tuned comparison

- Without tools: Framework is theoretical; With tools: Framework is production-ready
- DIVA evidence: 100% reliability, 60-100 hours/month saved through tools/automation

#### 4. Tools & Automation Infrastructure

**CRITICAL SECTION — Required for all case studies**

Document your tools and automation setup:

**A. Master Functions (Deterministic Tools)**

What standardized functions did you create?

```markdown

| [Function 2] | [Purpose] | [Metric] | [Frequency] |
```

**B. Automation Platforms**

Did you use workflow automation? Document:
- **Platform:** n8n / make.io / Zapier / Custom scripts
- **Workflows created:** [Names and purposes]
- **Systems integrated:** [What platforms connected]

**F. Tools-LLM Division**

How did you divide tasks between LLM and tools?

| Task Type | Handled By | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| [e.g., Email composition] | LLM | Requires natural language, reasoning |
| [e.g., Email sending] | Tool (sendEmail) | Must be 100% reliable |
| [e.g., Data analysis] | LLM | Requires interpretation |
| [e.g., Data validation] | Tool (validator) | Must be deterministic |

**G. Tool ROI Metrics**

**Required:** Show measurable impact of tools/automation

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to complete all 5 framework stages?

**A:** No! Document whichever stage you're currently at. The framework is **adaptive** — you implement stages based on your information volume.

**Examples:**
- Stage 1: Small project, docs fit in context → perfectly valid case study
- Stage 2: Like DIVA, indexed corpus → excellent case study
- Stage 4: Achieved fine-tuning → exceptional case study

### Q: How long should my case study be?

**A:** 2,000-5,000 words typical. DIVA case study (~2,000 words) is a good reference.

**Focus on quality over length.**

### Q: Can I submit if my project is still in pilot/experimental phase?

**A:** Yes, but clearly mark status as "Pilot" or "Experimental" rather than "Production."

**Preference:** Production deployments with longitudinal data, but substantial pilots are valuable too.

### Q: What if I discover the framework doesn't work for my domain?

**A:** **Document that!** Negative results are valuable for research.

Include:
- What you tried
- Why it didn't work
- Domain-specific challenges
- Recommendations for adaptation

### Q: Do I need to open-source my project code?

**A:** No. The case study documents your **application of the framework**, not necessarily the code itself.

**However:** Sharing code/data (when possible) significantly increases research value.

### Q: How is co-authorship determined?

**A:**

**Automatic co-authorship:**
- Substantial case study (production validated, novel insights)
- Active collaboration on paper writing
- Significant contribution to framework understanding

**Paper-specific:**
- Case study-focused paper: You're primary author
- Multi-domain analysis: Co-author by contribution
- Framework methodology paper: By invitation

**Always discussed and agreed upon before submission.**

### Q: Can I update my case study after submission?

**A:** Yes! Case studies are living documents.

Submit updates via PR with:
- Description of changes
- Reason for update
- Updated metrics if applicable

### Q: What if I'm applying framework to a domain not listed?

**A:** **Excellent!** Novel domains are highly valuable.

Your case study helps demonstrate framework generalizability. Be thorough in explaining domain characteristics and challenges.

### Q: Do I need to use Cursor specifically?

**A:** No. Any AI-agent-enabled IDE works (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude + IDE, etc.).

**Requirement:** AI-augmented workflow at high velocity, not traditional manual coding.

### Q: How do I get help while developing my case study?

**A:** 
- **GitHub Discussions:** Ask questions publicly
- **GitHub Issues:** Report specific problems
- **Email:** bguan@fiu.edu for direct collaboration

**We're here to help!**
