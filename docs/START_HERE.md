## 🎯 The 3-Sentence Summary

**What:** A framework for building AI agents that learn from experience and evolve reliably, using adaptive stages (like computer memory hierarchy) based on information volume.

**Why:** Most research focuses on making agents smarter; we focus on making them maintainable, reliable, and production-ready—addressing the engineering lifecycle gap.

**How:** Progress through 5 stages (System Prompt → Docs → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning) as your domain knowledge grows, using proven patterns from DIVA (100% reliability, 87% efficiency, 3+ months production).

## ❓ Quick FAQ

### Q: What is this project about?

**A:** Engineering reliable AI agents that work in production, learn from experience, and evolve over time—addressing the "engineering lifecycle" gap in agentic AI research.

### Q: What's the "dual helix"?

**A:** Two complementary repos: This one (Engineering—how agents learn) + co-agenticOS (Governance—how agents behave safely). Both needed for reliable agentic intelligence.

### Q: What's novel about this framework?

**A:** Adaptive 5-stage progression based on information volume (like computer memory hierarchy), validated in production (DIVA: 3 months, 100% reliability), focuses on lifecycle not just capabilities.

### Q: How can I contribute?

**A:** Apply framework to your project, document it as a case study, submit via PR. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) Path A.

### Q: Do I need special tools?

**A:** Yes—AI-enabled IDE (Cursor recommended) and LLM access. This project operates at AI-augmented velocity.

### Q: What's the time commitment?

**A:** Reading: 2-3 hours. Application: 2-4 weeks. Case study write-up: 12-16 hours. Total: ~1 month.

### Q: What do I get?

**A:** Co-authorship on papers, recognition in project, collaboration opportunities, advancing the field.

### Q: Can I just read and learn?

**A:** Absolutely! All documentation is open. No contribution required to benefit.
