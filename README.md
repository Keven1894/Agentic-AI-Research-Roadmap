## Mission

**The Agentic-AI Lab explores how large-language-model agents can evolve through documented, reproducible, and production-grade workflows.** The goal is to make intelligent systems learn from real-world experience as human engineers do.

## Overview

This repository documents and open-sources the foundation of the **Agentic-AI Engineering Framework**, a systematic methodology that transforms AI from theoretical reasoning to practical, production-ready systems.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful theorists, **Agents are practitioners** — operating in real environments, performing concrete tasks, and learning through trial and feedback.

## The Core Framework

Our framework implements a closed learning loop:

> **Context → Documentation → Indexing → RAG → Fine-Tuning**

Where each stage strengthens the next:
- **Context** captures the working environment and raw artifacts
- **Documentation** turns experience into reusable knowledge
- **Indexing** organizes knowledge for retrieval and reasoning
- **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) connects AI reasoning to verified data
- **Fine-Tuning** distills accumulated experience into domain-specialized models

This transforms one-off AI experiments into **continuous, evidence-based AI systems**.

## Key Insight

**"LLM is the theorist, Agent is the practitioner."**

To bring AI from conversation to production, we must systematize how agents:
- Accumulate knowledge from real tasks
- Document their decision-making processes
- Evolve through structured feedback loops
- Persist context across interactions

## Research Vision

Establish a **repeatable, scalable, and evaluable Agentic-AI engineering framework** that integrates LLM reasoning with traditional software engineering discipline, enabling sustainable AI engineering where AI systems:
- Not only respond but **operate**
- Not only answer but **record**
- Not only reason but **evolve**

## Experimental Domains

We are validating this framework across multiple domains:

| Domain | Use Case | Expected Outcome |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **GIS / Environmental Data** | Automatic buoy data annotation, anomaly detection (EnviStor) | Validate RAG for spatiotemporal reasoning |
| **Digital Libraries** | Metadata repair, catalog enrichment (Dataverse) | Improve retrieval precision |
| **Education** | AI teaching assistants, research support | Demonstrate adaptive learning |
| **IT Operations** | Log analysis, system self-healing | Evaluate feedback loops |
| **Industry Applications** | Multi-agent coordination systems | Measure operational reliability |

## Engineering Framework

Based on the **Agentic-Dev Workflow**:

```
Plan → Implement → Verify → Document → Summarize → Iterate
```

**Core Elements:**
- `.cursor/rules.md` — Context-aware AI editing policy
- `decision_log/` — Persistent design rationale
- `daily/` — Auto-summaries of activity and changes
- **CI/CD + Changesets** — Continuous integration with changelog tracking
- **Documentation Site** — Public transparency and collaboration

## Collaboration

We welcome collaborations with:
- **Academic Institutions** — Research validation and datasets
- **Industry Partners** — Real-world deployment and feedback
- **Open Source Community** — Tools, benchmarks, and standards

**Current Partners:**
- FIU Library & GIS Center (lead)
- FIU Computer Science Department
- FIU Division of IT
- Pelican, OSG, and other research infrastructure partners

## Publications & Roadmap

**Stage 1 (2025 Q4):** Framework workshop paper  
**Stage 2 (2026 Q1-Q3):** Domain-specific case studies  
**Stage 3 (2026 Q4):** Integrative system paper  
**Stage 4 (2027):** Monograph and curriculum development

See [Research Timeline](docs/Research-Timeline-2025-2027.md) for detailed milestones.

## Expected Outcomes
